## Who will be responsible for each part of Deliverables #1.

    1. Why intended application is valuable

    The overall intention of the application is to provide a space for artists to share their artwork. If it's drawings, paintings, designs, sculptures, or whatever form it might take, this website will help them get it in front of an audience and show it to others. Anything they create that is worth sharing can be done so with our application.

    This website will not only allow people to share their own creative work among each other, but to also comment or favorite certain pieces and follow artists they enjoy as well. The aim will be to encourage a community of creative minds to learn from one another, possibly collaborate, and hopefully better their skills as well.

    The final use case, and potentially the most valuable, will be for artists to use our application to venture into the professional world. By making an account and populating it with one's work, an artist can build up a portfolio and hopefully use it to promote themselves, build a following, sell their creations, and maybe even land a studio job.
